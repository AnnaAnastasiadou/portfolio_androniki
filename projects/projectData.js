Inspired by Homo Ludens, play is understood not as structured activity but as spontaneous, sensory encounters that invite connection. Through literature, ethnography, interviews, and spatial analysis, the study reveals how different generations feel isolation differently—and how the spaces around them quietly shape these experiences.</p><p>In response, it proposes a series of design principles and imagines a “playful periphery”: a network of accessible, inclusive, and health-supporting spaces that spark curiosity and draw people into gentle interaction. Ultimately, the thesis frames loneliness as inseparable from environmental conditions, suggesting that when cities weave play, sensory richness, and care into their fabric, they create places where belonging can slowly take root again.</p>',

The research argues that the architect’s role is not fixed but shifts in response to changing socio-political conditions. Through analysis of academic literature from both sides of Cyprus, primary planning documents, drawings, and interviews with key members of the bi-communal team, the study identifies four evolving roles: architects as providers of practical solutions, deployers of politicians’ visions, producers of political vision, and potentially as facilitators of public participation. The thesis concludes that while early technical collaboration helped build trust and enable cooperation, later political divergence limited the plan’s unifying potential. Nevertheless, the Nicosia Master Plan demonstrates how architecture and planning can act as critical tools in navigating conflict, fostering dialogue, and imagining shared futures in divided cities.',

The second, was a cozy spot closer to the water and deeper into the park, where the soundscape consisted of primarily natural sounds, which created a more engulfing and protective environments from outside stimuli. Lastly, the third soundscape was an area of fast and turbulent water, which cancelled out most other sounds but created this environment of fast movement and fluidity.',

Building on foundational theories by Kevin Lynch and Nasar, the research develops and tests an improved, more nuanced mental mapping approach that captures both tangible and intangible dimensions of spatial cognition, including movement, memory, atmosphere, and learning practices. The TU Delft campus is used as a case study and experimental setting, functioning as a condensed version of the city and offering accessible yet complex spatial conditions. Through iterative mental mapping exercises and interviews with students from different faculties and stages of study, the project evaluates the strengths, limitations, and interpretive potential of mental mapping as a research method. The findings demonstrate how methodological adjustments can reveal richer, more human-centered insights into spatial experience, supporting the use of mental mapping as a transferable tool for urban analysis, architectural research, and spatial design beyond the campus context.',
