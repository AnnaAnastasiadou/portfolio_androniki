This is situated in Pendrecht, a post-war landscape shaped by fragmentation and distance. Inspired by Homo Ludens, play is understood not as structured activity but as spontaneous, sensory encounters that invite connection. Through literature, ethnography, interviews, and spatial analysis, the study reveals how different generations feel isolation differently—and how the spaces around them quietly shape these experiences.</p><p>In response, it proposes a series of design principles and imagines a “playful periphery”: a network of accessible, inclusive, and health-supporting spaces that spark curiosity and draw people into gentle interaction. Ultimately, the thesis frames loneliness as inseparable from environmental conditions, suggesting that when cities weave play, sensory richness, and care into their fabric, they create places where belonging can slowly take root again.</p>',

The research argues that the architect’s role is not fixed but shifts in response to changing socio-political conditions. Through analysis of academic literature from both sides of Cyprus, primary planning documents, drawings, and interviews with key members of the bi-communal team, the study identifies four evolving roles: architects as providers of practical solutions, deployers of politicians’ visions, producers of political vision, and potentially as facilitators of public participation. The thesis concludes that while early technical collaboration helped build trust and enable cooperation, later political divergence limited the plan’s unifying potential. Nevertheless, the Nicosia Master Plan demonstrates how architecture and planning can act as critical tools in navigating conflict, fostering dialogue, and imagining shared futures in divided cities.',
