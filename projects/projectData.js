The outcomes of both the literature research together with the ethnographic research were translated into tangible design guidelines, divided into the building and neighbourhood scale. The findings are also summarised in the research paper.',

The idea is that people have direct contact with each other and check up on one another as with cases of chronic loneliness someone might not leave their house for several days. So this direct visibility between people is needed to facilitate an environment where people check up on each other and care.</p><p>The shared spaces, in turn, provide the valuable nodes of interaction as they create moments of spontaneity where people can unexpectedly connect through activity. This is valuable in terms of social and emotional loneliness, as these can act as small but consistent encounters to bring someone out of the viscous cycle.</p>',

This is situated in Pendrecht, a post-war landscape shaped by fragmentation and distance. Inspired by Homo Ludens, play is understood not as structured activity but as spontaneous, sensory encounters that invite connection. Through literature, ethnography, interviews, and spatial analysis, the study reveals how different generations feel isolation differently—and how the spaces around them quietly shape these experiences.</p><p>In response, it proposes a series of design principles and imagines a “playful periphery”: a network of accessible, inclusive, and health-supporting spaces that spark curiosity and draw people into gentle interaction. Ultimately, the thesis frames loneliness as inseparable from environmental conditions, suggesting that when cities weave play, sensory richness, and care into their fabric, they create places where belonging can slowly take root again.</p>',
