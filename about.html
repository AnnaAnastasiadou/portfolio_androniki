                    <p>
                        I am a 24-year-old architect from Cyprus, graduated with
                        honours from TU Delft, following a Bachelor’s degree
                        from the Welsh School of Architecture (WSA). I am driven
                        by a fascination with how spaces shape the emotional and
                        social fabric of our lives. I see architecture as a
                        facilitator of social resilience — a field through which
                        connection, health, and sustainability can quietly
                        emerge from the way we design, inhabit, and remember
                        places.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My work moves between research, storytelling, and
                        design, often drawing on anthropological methods and
                        collective narratives to understand the subtle
                        interactions between people and their environments. Each
                        project begins as a question rather than a form — an
                        exploration of how architecture can strengthen
                        relationships, preserve memory, and create continuity
                        within change. Through programmatic design, crafted
                        spatial sequences, and sensitivity to heritage, I seek
                        to create spaces that feel both grounded and
                        transformative with the intention of cultivating
                        connection and community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of architecture, I explore creativity through
                        painting, printing, and collaging, and I enjoy music,
                        movies, and other forms of storytelling. My personal
                        interests, alongside my professional practice, reflect a
                        curiosity about the human experience and the ways in
                        which art, culture, and design intersect to shape the
                        world around us.
